# HurriScan

## Project Description
HurriScan is a database integrated web application designed to provide accurate wind and temperature data for businesses and organizations on the seas, providing helpful predictions and hurricane warnings to keep people on the coast and seas safe.

## Dataset
We will be using the **El Ni√±o** dataset collected with the Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) array which was developed by the international Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) program.
The data set contains oceanographic and surface meteorological readings taken from a series of buoys positioned throughout the equatorial Pacific.
